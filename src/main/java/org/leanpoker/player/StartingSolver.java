/* Chen Formula:
Score your highest card only. Do not add any points for your lower card.
A = 10 points.
K = 8 points.
Q = 7 points.
J = 6 points.
10 to 2 = 1/2 of card value. (e.g. a 6 would be worth 3 points)
Multiply pairs by 2 of one cardâ€™s value. However, minimum score for a pair is 5.
(e.g. KK = 16 points, 77 = 7 points, 22 = 5 points)
Add 2 points if cards are suited.
Subtract points if there is a gap between the two cards.
No gap = -0 points.
1 card gap = -1 points.
2 card gap = -2 points.
3 card gap = -4 points.
4 card gap or more = -5 points. (Aces are high this step, so hands like A2, A3 etc. have a 4+ gap.)
Add 1 point if there is a 0 or 1 card gap and both cards are lower than a Q. (e.g. JT, 75, 32 etc, this bonus point does not apply to pocket pairs)
Round half point scores up. (e.g. 7.5 rounds up to 8)
